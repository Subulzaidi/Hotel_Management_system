# Vic Modern Hotel Network Infrastructure Project

## Introduction
The modernization of network systems within Vic Modern Hotel is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and guest satisfaction. This report outlines the proposed design and implementation of a comprehensive network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Aims & Objectives
The primary aim of this project is to design and implement a network infrastructure tailored to the specific needs of Vic Modern Hotel. The objectives are as follows:
- **Floor-wise Segmentation:** Segment the network to accommodate the different functions across the three floors of the hotel: reception, store, logistics, finance, HR, sales/marketing, IT, and administration.
- **Network Optimization:** Design a network layout that optimizes communication and data transfer between various departments while ensuring security and reliability.
- **Scalability:** Implement a network infrastructure that can easily accommodate future expansions and technological advancements.

## Features
1. **Three Routers:** Connect each floor with routers placed in the server room in the IT department.
2. **Inter-Router Connections:** Connect all routers using serial DCE cables.
3. **Switches:** Each floor should have at least one switch.
4. **Wi-Fi Networks:** Provide Wi-Fi networks on each floor for PCs and mobile phones.
5. **Printers:** Equip each department with a printer.
6. **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Implement inter-VLAN routing to enable communication between different departments while maintaining network segregation.
7. **Remote Login Testing:** Add a PC in the IT department and use it to test remote login.
8. **Device Communication:** Ensure all devices in the network can communicate with each other.
9. **OSPF Routing Protocol:** Use OSPF as the routing protocol to advertise routes.
10. **SSH Configuration:** Configure SSH on all routers for remote login.

## Skill Level Attained & Learning Outcomes
### Skill Level Attained
- Proficiency in designing and configuring VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and QoS policies.
- Understanding of network security principles and hands-on experience in implementing access control lists (ACLs) and other security measures.
- Proficiency in diagnosing and resolving network issues.
- Collaboration skills and project management experience.

### Learning Outcomes
Participants will learn:
- How to plan and implement network segmentation strategies, optimize traffic flow, and prioritize network resources for critical applications.
- How to assess network security requirements, implement security protocols to protect sensitive data, and mitigate potential security threats.
- Problem-solving skills by identifying and troubleshooting network problems, applying systematic troubleshooting methodologies, and effectively resolving issues to ensure uninterrupted network operation.

## Tentative Output
The expected output of this project is a fully functional Hotel Management System prototype, implemented and tested within the Cisco Packet Tracer environment. The prototype will demonstrate the key features outlined above and showcase the integration of various modules to automate hotel operations effectively. Additionally, documentation including system architecture, user manuals, and troubleshooting guides will be provided to facilitate understanding and future maintenance of the system.
